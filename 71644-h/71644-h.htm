<p class="nind"><i><span class="smcap">When</span> the exertions of an Individual to improve his profession are
crowned with success, it is certainly the highest gratification his
feelings can experience. The very distinguished approbation that
attended the publication of the ornamented edition of Goldsmith’s
Traveller, Deserted Village, and Parnell’s Hermit, which was last year
offered to the Public as a Specimen of the improved State of Typography
in this Country, demands my warmest acknowledgments; and is no less
satisfactory to the different Artists who contributed their efforts
towards the completion of the work.</i></p>

<p><i>The Chase, by Somervile, is now given as a Companion to Goldsmith; and
it is almost superfluous to observe, that the subjects which ornament
the present volume, being entirely composed of Landscape Scenery and
Animals, are adapted, above all others, to display the beauties of Wood
Engraving.</i></p>

<p><i>Unfortunately for his friends, and the admirers of the art of Engraving
on Wood, I have the painful task of announcing the death of my early
acquaintance and friend, the younger Mr. Bewick. He died at Ovingham, on
the banks of the Tyne, in December last, of a pulmonary complaint.
Previously, however, to his departure from London for the place of his
nativity, he had prepared, and indeed finished on wood, the whole of the
designs, except one, which embellish the Chase; they may therefore
literally be considered as the last efforts of this ingenious and much
to be lamented Artist.</i></p>

<p><i>In executing the Engravings, his Brother, Mr. Thomas Bewick, has
bestowed every possible care; and the beautiful effect produced from
their joint labours will, it is presumed, fully meet the approbation of
the Subscribers.</i></p>

<h2><a id="WILLIAM_SOMERVILE"></a>WILLIAM SOMERVILE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span><span class="smcap">hat</span> celebrity has not always been the attendant on merit, many
mortifying examples may be produced to prove. Of those who have by their
writings conferred a lasting obligation on their country, and at the
same time raised its reputation, many have been suffered to descend into
the grave without any memorial; and when the time has arrived, in which
their works have raised a curiosity to be informed of the general
tenour, or petty habits of their lives, always amusing, and frequently
useful, little more is to be collected, than that they once lived, and
are no more.</p>

<p>Such has been the fate of William Somervile, who may, with great
propriety, be called the Poet of the Chase; and of whom it is to be
regretted that so few circumstances are known. By the neglect of friends
while living, and the want of curiosity in the publick, at the time of
his death, he has been deprived of that portion of fame to which his
merits have entitled him; and though the worth of his works is now
universally acknowledged, his amiable qualities, and he is said to have
possessed many,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span> are forgotten and irrevocably lost to the world. In the
lapse of more than half a century, all his surviving friends, from whom
any information could be derived, are swept away. The little which has
been hitherto collected concerning him, will be found, on examination,
not perfectly satisfactory; and of that little, some part is less
accurate than our respect for so excellent a writer leads us to wish it
had been.</p>

<p>He was of a family of great antiquity in the county of Warwick. His
ancestor came into England with William the Conqueror, and left two
sons. The eldest, from whom our poet was descended, had Whichnour, in
the county of Stafford, for his inheritance; and the other, the ancestor
of Lord Somervile, settled in the kingdom of Scotland. The eldest branch
afterwards removed to Ederston, in the county of Warwick; which manor
Thomas Somervile became possessed of, by marrying Joan, daughter and
sole heir of John Aylesbury, the last heir male who owned that estate.
This Thomas died in the year 1501, leaving one son, Robert, who also
left one son, John, who was the father of William Somervile, whose only
son, Sir William Somervile, Knight, left a posthumous son, William, who
died in 1676, having married Anne, daughter of John<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span> Viscount Tracey, of
the kingdom of Ireland, by whom he had eleven sons and five daughters.
Of this numerous progeny, none seem to have survived except Robert, who
married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir Charles Wolseley, and by her
became the father of three sons; 1. our author; 2. Robert, who was
killed in India; and, 3. Edward, who was of New College, Oxford; where
he took the degree of B. C. L. December 7, 1710, and D. C. L. April 26,
1722, and died between the years 1733 and 1742.</p>

<p>William Somervile, our poet, was born in the year 1677, at Ederston,
“near Avona’s winding stream,” as he himself records in one of his
poems. At the age of thirteen, in the year 1690, he was admitted a
scholar of Winchester College, and continued there until the year 1694,
when he was sent to New College, Oxford. It does not appear, as Dr.
Johnson observes, that in the places of his education, he exhibited any
uncommon proofs of genius or literature. He is said, by the same author,
to have been elected a Fellow of New College; but as he does not seem to
have taken any degree at the university, that assertion may be doubted.
It is more probable, that he soon quitted the college for the country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
where his powers were first displayed, and where he was distinguished as
a poet, a gentleman, and a skilful and useful justice of the peace.</p>

<p>How soon he began to write verses we are not informed, there being few
dates in his poems; but it is certain that he was no early candidate for
literary fame. He had reached the age of fifty years, before he
presented any of his works to the publick, or was the least known. In
the year 1727, he published his first volume of Poems; the merit of
which, like most collections of the same kind, is various. Dr. Johnson
says, that, “though, perhaps, he has not, in any mode of poetry, reached
such excellence as to raise much envy, it may commonly be said, at
least, that he ‘writes very well for a gentleman.’ His serious pieces
are sometimes elevated, and his trifles are sometimes elegant. In his
verses to Addison, the couplet which mentions <i>Clio</i>, is written with
the most exquisite delicacy of praise: it exhibits one of those happy
strokes that are seldom attained. In his Odes to Marlborough, there are
beautiful lines; but in the second ode, he shows that he knew little of
his hero, when he talks of his private virtues. His subjects are
commonly such as require no great depth of thought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span> or energy of
expression. His fables are generally stale, and therefore excite no
curiosity. Of his favourite, <i>the Two Springs</i>, the fiction is
unnatural, and the moral inconsequential. In his tales, there is too
much coarseness, with too little care of language, and not sufficient
rapidity of narration.” To the justice of this estimate, it may be
doubted whether an unreserved assent will be readily given. Dr. Johnson
has often dealt out his praise with too scanty and parsimonious a hand.</p>

<p>His success as an author, whatever were his merits at that time, was
however sufficient not to discourage his further efforts. In the year
1735, he produced the work now republished: a work, which has scarce
ever been spoken of but to be commended, though Dr. Johnson, whose
habits of life, and bodily defects, were little calculated to taste the
beauties of this poem, or to enter into the spirit of it, coldly says,
“to this poem, praise cannot be totally denied.” He adds, however, “he
(the author,) is allowed by sportsmen to write with great intelligence
of his subject, which is the first requisite to excellence; and though
it is impossible to interest common readers of verse in the dangers or
the pleasures of the chase, he has done all that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_x">{x}</a></span> transition and variety
could easily effect; and has, with great propriety, enlarged his plan by
the modes of hunting used in other countries.” Dr. Warton observes, that
he “writes with all the spirit and fire of an eager sportsman. The
description of the hunting the hare, the fox, and the stag, are
extremely spirited, and place the very objects before our eyes: of such
consequence is it for a man to write on that, which he hath frequently
felt with pleasure.”</p>

<p>Many other testimonies might be added; but its best praise, is the
continued succession of new editions since its original publication.</p>

<p>As Mr. Somervile advanced in life, his attention to literary pursuits
increased. In the year 1740, he produced “Hobbinol, or the Rural Games;”
a burlesque poem, which Dr. Warton has classed among those best
deserving notice, of the mock heroick species. It is dedicated to Mr.
Hogarth, as the greatest master in the burlesque way; and at the
conclusion of his preface, the author says, “If any person should want a
key to this poem, his curiosity shall be gratified. I shall in plain
words tell him, ‘it is a satire against the luxury, the pride, the
wantonness, and quarrelsome<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> temper of the middling sort of people,’ As
these are the proper and genuine cause of that barefaced knavery, and
almost universal poverty, which reign without control in every place;
and as to these we owe our many bankrupt farmers, our trade decayed, and
lands uncultivated, the author has reason to hope, that no honest man,
who loves his country, will think this short reproof out of season; for,
perhaps, this merry way of bantering men into virtue, may have a better
effect than the most serious admonitions, since many who are proud to be
thought immoral, are not very fond of being ridiculous.”</p>

<p>He did not yet close his literary labours. In the year 1742, a few
months only before his death, he published <i>Field Sports</i>; a poem
addressed to the Prince of Wales; and from Lady Luxborough’s letters we
learn, that he had translated Voltaire’s Alzira, which, with several
other pieces not published, were in her possession. One of these,
written towards the close of life, is so descriptive of the old age of a
sportsman, and exhibits so pleasing a picture of the temper and turn of
mind of the author, we shall here insert. It is an “Address to his Elbow
Chair, new clothed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span>”</p>

<p>To those who have derived entertainment or instruction from Mr.
Somervile’s works, the information will be received with pain, that the
latter part of his life did not pass without those embarrassments which
attend a deranged state of pecuniary circumstances. Shenstone, who in
this particular much<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span> resembled him, thus notices his lamentable
catastrophe. “Our old friend Somervile is dead! I did not imagine I
could have been so sorry as I find myself on this occasion. Sublatum
quærimus. I can now excuse all his foibles; impute them to age, and to
distress of circumstances: the last of these considerations wrings my
very soul to think on. For a man of high spirit, conscious of having (at
least in one production,) generally pleased the world, to be plagued and
threatened by wretches that are low in every sense; to be forced to
drink himself into pains of the body, in order to get rid of the pains
of the mind, is a misery which I can well conceive; because I may,
without vanity, esteem myself his equal in point of economy, and,
consequently, ought to have an eye to his misfortunes.” Dr. Johnson
says, “his distresses need not to be much pitied; his estate is said to
have been fifteen hundred a year, which by his death devolved to Lord
Somervile of Scotland. His mother, indeed, who lived till ninety, had a
jointure of six hundred.” This remark is made with less consideration
than might have been expected, from so close an observer of mankind.
Such an estate, incumbered in such a manner, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span> otherwise,
frequently leaves the proprietor in a very uneasy situation, with but a
scanty pittance; and it is evident, that our author was by no means an
economist. Shenstone says, “for whatever the world might esteem in poor
Somervile, I really find, upon critical inquiry, that I loved him for
nothing so much as his flocci-nauci-nihili-pili-fication of money.” Lady
Luxborough declares him to have been a gentleman who deserved the esteem
of every good man, and one who was regretted accordingly.</p>

<p>He died July 19, 1742, and was buried at Wotton, near Henley on Arden.
He had been married to Mary, daughter of Hugh Bethel, of Yorkshire, who
died before him, without leaving any issue. By his will, proved the
third of September, 1742, he remembered New College, the place of his
education, by leaving to the master and fellows, fifteen volumes of
Montfaucon’s Antiquities, and Addison’s works, for their library; and,
apparently to encourage provincial literature, he bequeathed twenty
pounds to purchase books for the parish library of the place of his
residence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> old and infirm have at least this privilege, that they can recall to
their minds those scenes of joy in which they once delighted, and
ruminate over their past pleasures, with a satisfaction almost equal to
the first enjoyment; for those ideas, to which any agreeable sensation
is annexed, are easily excited, as leaving behind them the most strong
and permanent impressions. The amusements of our youth are the boast and
comfort of our declining years. The ancients carried this notion even
yet further, and supposed their heroes, in the Elysian fields, were fond
of the very same diversions they exercised on earth: death itself could
not wean them from the accustomed sports and gaities of life.</p>

<p class="nind">I hope, therefore, I may be indulged, even by the more grave and
censorious part of mankind, if, at my leisure hours, I run over, in my
elbow-chair, some of those chases, which were once the delight of a more
vigorous age. It is an entertaining, and, as I conceive, a very innocent
amusement. The result of these rambling imaginations will be found in
the following poem; which if equally diverting to my readers, as to
myself, I shall have gained my end. I have intermixed the preceptive
parts with so many descriptions, and digressions, in the Georgick
manner, that I hope they will not be tedious. I am sure they are very
necessary to be well understood by any gentleman, who would enjoy this
noble sport in full perfection. In this, at least, I may comfort myself,
that I cannot trespass upon their patience more than Markham, Blome, and
the other prose writers upon this subject.</p>

<p>It is most certain, that hunting was the exercise of the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xix">{xix}</a></span>
heroes of antiquity. By this they formed themselves for war; and their
exploits against wild beasts were a prelude to their future victories.
Xenophon says, that almost all the ancient heroes, Nestor, Theseus,
Castor, Pollux, Ulysses, Diomedes, Achilles, &amp;c. were MαΘηζαὶ
Kυνηγεδιῶν, disciples of hunting; being taught carefully that art, as
what would be highly serviceable to them in military discipline. <i>Xen.
Cynegetic.</i> And Pliny observes, those who were designed for great
captains, were first taught, “certare cum fugacibus feris cursu, cum
audacibus robore, cum callidus astu:”&mdash;to contest with the swiftest wild
beasts in speed; with the boldest in strength; with the most cunning, in
craft and subtilty. <i>Plin. Panegyr.</i> And the Roman emperors, in those
monuments they erected to transmit their actions to future ages, made no
scruple to join the glories of the chase to their most celebrated
triumphs. Neither were their poets wanting to do justice to this heroick
exercise. Beside that of Oppian in Greek, we have several poems in Latin
upon hunting. Gratius was contemporary with Ovid; as appears by this
verse,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aptaque venanti Gratius arma dabit.<br></span>

</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gratius shall arm the huntsman for the chase.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But of his works only some fragments remain. There are many others of
more modern date. Among these Nemesianus, who seems very much superiour
to Gratius, though of a more degenerate age. But only a fragment of his
first book is preserved. We might indeed have expected to have seen it
treated more<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xx">{xx}</a></span> at large by Virgil in his third Georgick, since it is
expressly part of his subject. But he has favoured us only with ten
verses; and what he says of dogs, relates wholly to greyhounds and
mastiffs:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The greyhound swift, and mastiff’s furious breed.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And he directs us to feed them with butter-milk.&mdash;“Pasce sero pingui.”
He has, it is true, touched upon the chase in the fourth and seventh
books of the Æneid. But it is evident, that the art of hunting is very
different now, from what it was in his days, and very much altered and
improved in these latter ages. It does not appear to me, that the
ancients had any notion of pursuing wild beasts, by the scent only, with
a regular and well-disciplined pack of hounds; and therefore they must
have passed for poachers amongst our modern sportsmen. The muster-roll
given us by Ovid, in his story of Actæon, is of all sorts of dogs, and
of all countries. And the description of the ancient hunting, as we find
it in the antiquities of Pere de Montfaucon, taken from the sepulchre of
the Nasos, and the arch of Constantine, has not the least trace of the
manner now in use.</p>

<p>Whenever the ancients mention dogs following by the scent, they mean no
more than finding out the game by the nose of one single dog. This was
as much as they knew of the “odora canum vis.” Thus Nemesianus says,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Odorato noscunt vestigia prato,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Atque etiam leporum secreta cubilia monstrant.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They challenge on the mead the recent stains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And trail the hare unto her secret form.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Oppian has a long description of these dogs in his first book, from ver.
479 to 526. And here, though he seems to describe the hunting of the
hare by the scent, through many turnings and windings, yet he really
says no more than that one of those hounds, which he calls ἰχνευτῆρες
finds out the game. For he follows the scent no further than the hare’s
form; from whence, after he has started her, he pursues her by sight. I
am indebted for these two last remarks to a reverend and very learned
gentleman, whose judgment in the belles-lettres nobody disputes, and
whose approbation gave me the assurance to publish this poem.</p>

<p>Oppian also observes, that the best sort of these finders were brought
from Britain; this island having always been famous, as it is at this
day, for the best breed of hounds, for persons the best skilled in the
art of hunting, and for horses the most enduring to follow the chase. It
is, therefore, strange that none of our poets have yet thought it worth
their while to treat of this subject; which is, without doubt, very
noble in itself, and very well adapted to receive the most beautiful
turns of poetry. Perhaps our poets have no great genius for hunting.
Yet, I hope, my brethren of the couples, by encouraging this first, but
imperfect essay, will shew the world they have at least some taste for
poetry.</p>

<p>The ancients esteemed hunting, not only as a manly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span> warlike
exercise, but as highly conducive to health. The famous Galen recommends
it above all others, as not only exercising the body, but giving delight
and entertainment to the mind. And he calls the inventors of this art
wise men, and well-skilled in human nature. <i>Lib. de parvæ pilæ
exercitio.</i></p>

<p>The gentlemen, who are fond of a jingle at the close of every verse, and
think no poem truly musical but what is in rhyme, will here find
themselves disappointed. If they will be pleased to read over the short
preface before the Paradise Lost, Mr. Smith’s Poem in memory of his
friend Mr. John Philips, and the Archbishop of Cambray’s Letter to
Monsieur Fontenelle, they may, probably, be of another opinion. For my
own part, I shall not be ashamed to follow the example of Milton,
Philips, Thomson, and all our best tragic writers.</p>

<p>Some few terms of art are dispersed here and there; but such only as are
absolutely requisite to explain my subject. I hope, in this, the
criticks will excuse me; for I am humbly of opinion, that the
affectation, and not the necessary use, is the proper object of their
censure.</p>

<p>But I have done. I know the impatience of my brethren, when a fine day,
and the concert of the kennel, invite them abroad. I shall therefore
leave my reader to such diversion, as he may find in the poem itself.</p>

<span class="i0">And beauty of the stream. Without remorse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This midnight pillager, ranging around,<br></span>

<span class="i0">The unpeopled rivulet, and gladly hears<br></span>
<span class="i0">The huntsman’s early call, and sees with joy<br></span>
<span class="i0">The jovial crew, that march upon its banks<br></span>
